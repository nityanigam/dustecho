# dustecho
This code describes a model for the dust echo from a transient source. The first part calculates the response (temperature change and sublimation) of the dust grains to the incoming radiation from the source, with user specified source light curve and spectrum. The second part calculates the light curve from the thermal emission from heated dust grains.
