# dustecho
The goal of this project is to compute the dust echo from a jetted transient source. We have developed a code that calculates the sublimation radius for dust grains of different sizes and the extinction in an iterative way, and then the volumetric emissivity is calculated from the dust temperatures for all grain sizes. Finally, we account for light-travel delays and obtain the lightcurve of dust echo from a given observerâ€™s viewing angle and observing wavelength.

The resulting lightcurves, as well as astrometric shift of the flux centroid, for a number of different circum-stellar medium hydrogen densities and observer's viewing angles are contained in files named like 'nH3_lam4.0um_theobs0.52_Ldnu_xcentr.txt', where the first number means hydrogen number density n_H = 3/cm^3, the second number is for observing wavelength of lambda = 4.0 micro-meter, and the third number is for observer's viewing angle of 0.52 radian with respect to the jet axis. A few of the files have 'on_axis' in their names, and they are for the case where the observer's line of sight coincident with the jet axis.

Inside each file, there are four rows (separated by '\n'). The first row shows the info for the observer's time grid, which is taken to be logarithmic grid between 'tobsmin' and 'tobsmax' with 'Ntobs' number of grid points and the right boundary is not included. For Python users, the time grid is given by

tobs = numpy.logspace(tobsmin, tobsmax, Ntobs)

The second line shows the meaning of the later two rows of numbers: 'Ldnu' is the specific luminosity [in erg/s/Hz] at the wavelength specificed in the filename; 'xcentr' is the projected distance [in pc] between the flux centroid and the center of explosion on the sky. The third row shows the value of 'Ldnu' and the last row shows 'xcentr', at each time grid. When Ldnu = 0 (dust echo hasn't arrived yet), we have xcentr = numpy.nan (does not exist).

Note that the dust echo from the counter jet (which propagates away from the observer) is not included, and we do not expect the counter-jet echo to contribute significantly to the total flux in the first decade after the explosion.

The authors plan to publish the computing code (written in Python 3.7) after the paper is accepted for publication. See arXiv:xxxx.xxxx for a description of the method used in this project.
